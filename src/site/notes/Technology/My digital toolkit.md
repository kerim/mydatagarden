While most of my advisors managed to be much more productive than I ever will be just using a manual typewriter and a hand written journal, I have always enjoyed trying out new tools to see what they can do. Below are some notes about my current digital toolkit. (Also see my article [[Technology/Working with Text\|Working with Text]] for some more general thoughts.)

## Writing and Research

- Note-taking : [Logseq](https://logseq.com/)
    - Inspired by [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/), which in turn was inspired by a long line of outliners going back to [MORE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MORE_%28application%29) which I used on a MacPlus in college, as well as [Workflowy](https://workflowy.com/) and [Dynalist](https://dynalist.io/). Unlike Roam Research, however, Logseq can save all the data as plain text files on your desktop. This means you can use it with other apps that can read the same files, such as [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
    - Here’s [an article I wrote](https://anthrodendum.org/2020/05/05/roam-if-you-want-to/) when I first started using this new generation of note taking apps that tries to explain what makes them so powerful.
    - And [here is a user's detailed discussion](https://discuss.logseq.com/t/my-logseq-workflow/2278) of how they use Logseq to take notes and organize their tasks.
- Writing: [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/) and [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com)
    - While Logseq is good for capturing and linking ideas, when I need to start writing I usually open up Ulysses, which offers a clean, distraction-free writing environment with a number of nice features. I especially like the ability to break up larger projects into a number of smaller documents that can be moved around. It also allows you to set writing goals and limits (such as 500 words, or reading-time of 10 minutes).
    - For formatting bibliographies in academic papers Ulysses is not very good ([unless you use EndNotes or Bookends](https://help.ulysses.app/kb/guide/en/add-citations-to-your-texts-reference-managers-jAK5803cAq/Steps/1064262,1064265)) but Zettlr works well with my preferred citation manager, Zotero (see below). Because both Zettlr and Ulysses can be set up to use plain markdown files (this requires turning off some special features in Ulysses) it is possible to switch seamlessly between the two apps.
    - Ulysses is on MacOS and iOS. Zettlr is only on the desktop, but has Windows and Linux versions as well.
    - Some people prefer [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview).
- Reference management: [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org)
    - Zotero is an open source bibliographic manager with apps on nearly every platform as well as a full featured web app. They also have an API that allows other apps to query your library in Zotero. And it is possible to set up private and public groups for sharing your library. With the latest update (version 6.0) Zotero has become easier to use and now features a full-fledged PDF reader as well.
    - I particularly like Zotero because it fits well into plain text workflows - allowing me to move between Zotero, Logseq, Ulysses, Zettlr, etc. without having to worry too much about my bibliographic data breaking between apps.
    - Before I used Zotero I used [Paperpile](https://paperpile.com/app), which is a much slicker app and probably a lot easier to use. (To get Zotero set up the way I wanted required installing numerous extensions maid by third party developers, and the interface for Zotero still feels stuck in the 90s.) While Paperpile is working on better support for plain text workflows, but it could be some time before it is ready.
- “Read Later” service: [Upnext](https://www.getupnext.com/)
    - Save newspaper articles and blog posts to read later on your phone or in a dedicated web app. Allows you to take highlights as well as listen to audio (if the original web page has an audio version of the article).
    - Some people use [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/en/), or [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/), but Instapaper has been neglected by its new owners.
- Digital Archive: [DEVONthink](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink)
    - This is where I keep all my document scans, and non-academic PDFs. I also dump a lot of other stuff in there, like old notes and stuff that I might need to search now again but don’t use too much.
    - I used to use [Evernote](https://evernote.com/), but I wasn’t happy with the current app, so I switched.

## Other Tools

- Presentations: [Deckset](https://www.deckset.com/)
    - Make presentations out of a single (markdown formatted) plaintext file. Very easy to use.
    - MacOS only.
    - I also like to use [Notion](https://notion.so) for my lecture notes, which you can turn into presentation slides using [this website](https://wunderpresentation.com/).
- Blogging: [Blot](https://blot.im/)
    - Stupidly simple blogging. Just put any file in a dropbox folder and it becomes a blog post! No interface really, you can use whatever text editor you like to edit the files. (It accepts plain text files or Word documents, etc. and you can add images as well.)
- Transcription: [oTranscribe](https://otranscribe.com/)
    - Free app for transcribing audio or video.
    - Works in your browser, but your data stays local, not in “the cloud.” Available in many languages.
- Collaborative Task Manager: [Todoist](https://todoist.com/)
    - I manage most of my daily tasks right inside Logseq (see above), but for working with others I used Todoist. There are many online collaborative task managers, but few that offer so many features for free, or which work if only one of the users has paid for a pro membership. Of these, Todoist is currently the best. It also works very well for grabbing websites as tasks via the Chrome extension or the iOS app, making it useful for bookmarking things that need to be checked off.
    - Available on every platform.
- This website: [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)
    - Notion makes editing the website as easy as editing a document in your word processor. I also use it to make dedicated pages for each of the classes I teach - accessible only to the students in that class.
    - Unfortunately, Notion websites are not well indexed by search engines, and don’t let you use your own domain name. There are some [free tools](https://fruitionsite.com/) to fix this, but I found them hard to use, so I signed up with [Simple.Ink](https://simple.ink/).
