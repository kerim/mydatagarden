(With a focus on Austronesian/Indigenous studies.)

There are an increasing number of international graduate programs opening up in Taiwan, and many of these are focused around Austronesian studies. Here are some that I’ve found, including at my own university, NDHU in Hualien. All the programs on this page are English-taught, unless otherwise specified.

## MA Programs

- Note: Fulbright now offers funding for several MA programs in Taiwan. Although Fulbright awards are limited, it is also possible to apply directly to these programs, and other sources of funding may be possible. I have listed Fulbright information where available.
- [NDHU Master’s Degree Program in Ethnic Relations and Cultures](https://rc025.ndhu.edu.tw/index.php)
    - This program is Chinese taught, but intermediate-to-advanced learners of Chinese should be able to manage as most homework and you MA thesis can be submitted in English. Additionally, students who apply via Fulbright will receive a year of intensive Chinese study at NDHU before you start classes.
    - This program is located within the College of Indigenous Studies, a program specifically set up for Indigenous students and scholarship on Indigenous issues.
