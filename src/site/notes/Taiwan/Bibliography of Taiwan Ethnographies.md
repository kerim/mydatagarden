This page aims to list every book based (in whole or part) on ethnographic research in Taiwan. It is an ongoing project so please check back regularly. The data is drawn from a public Zotero group library, [which can be viewed here](https://www.zotero.org/groups/4456737/ethnographies_of_taiwan/items/CSSFUWPC/library). (The Zotero version will always be more up-to-date than this page.)

Note: currently the bibliography is limited to English language texts, but that may change later on.

Current team includes: Kerim Friedman, Brendan Galipeau, J.B. Klich, and Eliana Ritts.
