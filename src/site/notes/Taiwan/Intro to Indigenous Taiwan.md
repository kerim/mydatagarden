I often get asked about resources to learn about Indigenous Taiwanese culture and history, especially for people who are just starting off. Although I try to write [my own publications](https://kerim.oxus.net/peer-reviewed-publications) with a wide audience in mind (and I cite widely, making the bibliographies a useful resource on their own), I know there is a need for a more basic starting point. On this page I’ve collected some of those references.

## Style guides

Writing about Indigenous issues in English can be tricky, since the language we use continues to change in response to ongoing social movements. For this reason it helps to consult Indigenous style guides on proper usage. I’ve made a separate page for this: [[Education/Indigenous Style Guides\|Indigenous Style Guides]]

## General Texts

- While I wish there was a nice book length text which served this purpose, right now one of the best places to start is actually [the Wikipedia page on this topic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwanese_indigenous_peoples). Fortunately, it is pretty well put together.
- There are then three edited volumes that are excellent starting points:
    - Blundell, David, ed. 2009. _Austronesian Taiwan: Linguistics, History, Ethnology, Prehistory_. (2nd edition). Shung Ye Museum of Formosan Aborigines.
    - Fell, Dafydd, Daniel Davies, and Chia-Yuan Huang. 2021. _Taiwan’s Contemporary Indigenous Peoples_. Routledge. (Available this July)
    - Shih, Shu-Mei, and Lin-Chin Tsai, eds. 2021. _Indigenous Knowledge in Taiwan and Beyond_. Springer, Singapore.
- And here is a collection of Indigenous Taiwanese literature
    - Balcom, John, and Yingtish Balcom. 2005. _Indigenous Writers of Taiwan: An Anthology of Stories, Essays, and Poems_. Columbia University Press.
- The syllabus for my course on “[Indigenous Taiwan on Screen](https://kerim.oxus.net/syllabi/indigenous-taiwan-on-screen/)” also contains some useful introductory texts, and a lot of great films as well.
- Also see my page on [[Taiwan/Taiwan Maps and Guides\|Taiwan Maps and Guides]] where I include Cheryl Robbins guide books for traveling in Indigenous Areas.
