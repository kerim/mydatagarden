This page is still a work in progress, but I hope to add information here about postdocs, job hunting, turning your PhD into a book, and working in academia.

## Job Hunting

- [The Professor Is In](https://theprofessorisin.com/) is a book, a blog, an online forum, etc. A very useful guide.

## Working in academia

- [Advice for new assistant professors](https://miryaholman.substack.com/p/advice-for-new-assistant-professors)
- [Matthew Wolf-Meyer's advice on professionalization](https://matthewwolfmeyer.com/professionalization-material/) (including publishing articles, turning your dissertation into a book, and getting tenure, etc.)

## Working outside academia

- *[Leaving Academia: A Practical Guide](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691200200/leaving-academia)*
