## Getting into graduate school

- [Master’s degrees are the second biggest scam in higher education.](https://slate.com/business/2021/07/masters-degrees-debt-loans-worth-it.html) (Not so bad in Taiwan, where the costs are lower and many foreign MA students have funding, but I often warn students away from MA programs in the US and UK. Often better to just do a PhD directly, or do an MA in Taiwan and then a PhD abroad.)
