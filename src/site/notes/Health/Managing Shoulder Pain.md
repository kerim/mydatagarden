It is not uncommon that people who have restricted hip movement on one side also have issues on the opposite shoulder. As I've managed to overcome my hip mobility issues and have started to focus on strengthening my upper body as well, it is therefore not surprising that I have started to develop shoulder pain. This page catalogs some of the exercises and tips which have helped me with that. For my hip related posts, see [[Health/Managing Hip Pain/Managing Hip Pain\|this page]].
