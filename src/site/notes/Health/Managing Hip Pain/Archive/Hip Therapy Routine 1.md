I try to do this three times a week. It takes about half an hour. In addition I have added a number of [glute strengthening exercises](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CYZRNkRqcu0/?utm_medium=copy_link) to my gym workout. I have a lot more exercises listed on my as [[Health/Managing Hip Pain/Exercises for hip pain\|Exercises for hip pain]] and [[Health/Managing Hip Pain/Stretches for hip pain\|Stretches for hip pain]] pages, but this is the actual routine I do myself when Iâ€™m not at the gym (or doing my [[Health/Home Workout Routine\|Home Workout Routine]]).
