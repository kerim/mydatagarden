Below are some exercises I’ve found useful. Depending on what your problem is, some of these might be more useful than others. That, in turn, might help you with [[Health/Managing Hip Pain/Diagnosing your hip pain\|Diagnosing your hip pain]].

Note, these are all supplementary exercises, not to be confused with a basic strength training exercise regime that you should be doing at the same time. You will need a personal trainer to make sure you are doing everything correctly. A good trainer is very expensive, but after two or three months you should be ready to start working out on your own, equipped with skills that will last a lifetime. (Thought it is good to check in with a trainer at least once a year to make sure you aren’t developing bad habits and to change your workout routine as your body changes.)

  ## The Big 3

In his years of studying the spine, Dr. McGill has found there to be three specific exercises that most efficiently address all of these areas [around the spine] without placing excessive stresses on the parts of the back that may be aggravated or irritated due to injury. This group of exercises has famously become known as ‘The Big 3.’ ([source](https://squatuniversity.com/2018/06/21/the-mcgill-big-3-for-core-stability/)) - Curl-Up - Side Plank - Bird-Dog
