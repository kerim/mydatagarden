Most people’s hips are a little uneven, but in some cases it can be worse than others. Hips might be uneven because of tightness or weakness on one side or the other (frequently) both. They might also be uneven because of having different length legs - which seems to be one of the sources of all my problems. Once I realized this and started adding these routines into my practice I could really feel the difference.
