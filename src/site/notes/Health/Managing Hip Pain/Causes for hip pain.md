Even if you manage to find exercises and stretches that relieve your symptoms, it is not unlikely that aspects of your lifestyle could continue to re-injure you if you don’t make changes. In this section I try to sort out some of the latest advice about things like standing vs. sitting, types of beds, etc.

## Sitting vs. Hip Flexors

- Our bodies tend to adapt to the positions that we put them in the most. Since the average American spends over 12 hours in a sitting position, this puts the hip flexors in a position that is not ideal ALL day. When sitting, these muscles are in what is considered a “shortened position” for the muscles. Basically, this means the muscles are all bunched up into each other for most of the day if we’re sitting . . . Sit enough and tightness will become the norm for these muscle groups, which could end up in a hip flexor strain. When these muscles are strained it can easily affect the whole body due to their role in core control and balance. It can start affecting your basic activities of daily living including walking, getting up and down from chairs, in and out of the car, your exercise routine (hopefully you have one), and even the way you sleep. When these muscles are strained the two biggest complaints tend to be muscle cramping in the hip flexor muscles themselves and low back pain (due to compensatory movements).

## Standing vs. Sitting

- “The solution to sitting isn’t to stand, though it helps. In fact, according to the findings of a 2015 consensus panel on the topic, we need to be on our feet two to four hours while at work. But the real solution is to move. All day. The stillness is what’s killing us. We should be pacing the hallways and climbing stairs and squatting and lunging and stretching.” ([source](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/06/exercise-health-move-all-day-standing-desk))

## The Ideal Bed

- Bed firmness? Sleeping on hard surfaces or soft surfaces? Effect on hips, shoulders, and back?

## Uneven Hips

- Most people’s hips are a little uneven, but in some cases it can be worse than others. Hips might be uneven because of tightness or weakness on one side or the other (frequently) both. They might also be uneven because of having different length legs. If you might have this, see my page: [[Health/Managing Hip Pain/Treating uneven hips\|Treating uneven hips]].
