As per my page on [[Health/Managing Hip Pain/Managing Hip Pain\|Managing Hip Pain]], I’ve made tremendous progress on my hips over the past two years, especially after doing my [[Health/Managing Hip Pain/Current Hip Therapy Routine/My Hip Therapy Routine\|My Hip Therapy Routine]]. However, while I’m no longer in constant pain, I still had some stiffness in my hip flexors that was making walking difficult. Fortunately, I was able to find some new exercises which have helped:

  

- [Standing Hip Flexor Stretch](https://youtu.be/3SVJvstoBR0?t=234)
- [High Hip Flexion Drills](https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a19527874/high-hip-flexion-drills/)
    - I do it seated in a chair, making it easy to transition to the next exercise
- Seated Pigeon Pose in Chair.
    - I couldn’t find a video of this that I could link to, but it is similar to [this more passive version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_lIHdo4AUY), except you actively engage the glute, pulling your knee towards the ground and then releasing.
- [half kneeling weight shift with kettlebell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT0KUNuY7QM)
- The next two exercises come from this [Squat University Instagram Reel](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CfctA_PgG6Q/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)
    - [banded pigeon pose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYlTQSKNlLI)
    - [Anterior Band Assisted Hip Capsule Stretch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZbTFwKZqv0&list=PL6Hl_ZZl_6P4ONj0PXmXqsF8pAd5R-w5i)
    - Note: there are many many variations on these kinds of band mobilizations.
    - This can be followed with single leg and dual leg glute bridges to activate the glutes
- [Posterior Hip Capsule Stretch (passive)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyasxpYx1fs)

  

UPDATE:

My latest discovery in the world of hip mobility is Connor Harris. He has some hip mobility drills that have really helped me. I recommend looking up his [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/conor_harris_/) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC634L9eG-YsskyzWxnp9BJA) channels. Here are two exercises that have particularly helped me with my tight hip flexors.
