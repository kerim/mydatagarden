For years I’ve struggled with hip pain. Like the story of the blind men and the elephant, doctors tend to see my issues through the lens of their own area of specialization, making it hard to get a good diagnosis. Finally, frustrated as the problem got worse and worse, I turned to YouTube* and now, for the first time in decades, I can feel that I’m on the mend. (*See a list of my favorite YouTue channels under [[Health/Resources\|Resources]].)

I’m not a doctor, and my problem may be different from yours, but on these pages I hope to share what I learned about diagnosing, managing, and even treating hip problems.

Proceed with caution and at your own risk!

    - Some basic principles

## My Routine

I keep updating my daily routine. These are exercises I do each morning to improve mobility and train supporting muscles that help my posture. I keep updating it based on both changes to my training needs as well as my evolving understanding of what is needed. The current routine takes about 30 min and has helped move me from 80% hip mobility to between 95 and 98 percent when walking.

## Shoes

I bought [a pair of wide-toe-box, zero-drop shoes](https://www.altrarunning.com/launch/2022/lone-peak-6.html) when I was in NY and love them. Instantly improved my walking, and I was especially happy to learn one can buy shoes like this which aren't "barefoot" shoes, but actually have some cushioning. If I had already improved my walking by 80% through physical therapy, switching shoes improved things by another 15% the second I started using them. I went back the next week and bought a second pair.

## Diagnosis, Causes, and Quick Relief

Here are some notes and videos that I kept over the course of my journey. I don't recommend everything here, but it is useful to begin your own research.

[[Health/Managing Hip Pain/Diagnosing your hip pain\|Diagnosing your hip pain]]

- It is very hard to identify the true cause of your problem. This is why the adage “listen to your body” is useless. A pain in your knee might originate in your hip, and vice-versa. (Hip pain can show up in the lower back, shoulders, groin, etc.) Also, it is not uncommon for stiffness or weakness in one area to be masking stiffness and weakness in another, so as you improve one area the other might initially get worse. To get to the bottom of it you need to test and re-test regularly! Ideally you should work with a trained therapist, but if that isn’t an option, these videos show you some of the tests that a therapist might do when evaluating you.

- Even if you manage to find exercises and stretches that relieve your symptoms, it is not unlikely that aspects of your lifestyle could continue to re-injure you if you don’t make changes. In this section I try to sort out some of the latest advice about things like standing vs. sitting, types of beds, etc.
