A lot of the advice out there is about how you should focus more on strengthening weak muscles than on stretching, but there are are some basic stretches you can and should do to help relieve and loosen tight hip flexors and correct pelvic tilt.

There is also a whole category of movements called “mobility exercises” which are designed to give you a greater range of motion in your joints, as opposed to trying to lengthen your muscles and tendons (which is a really hard thing to do).

## Stop stretching your hip flexors!

- Although I think there are some useful stretches you can (and should) do, some suggested by the same people in these videos, you should watch to learn why (just) stretching your hip flexors is not the best way to go.
